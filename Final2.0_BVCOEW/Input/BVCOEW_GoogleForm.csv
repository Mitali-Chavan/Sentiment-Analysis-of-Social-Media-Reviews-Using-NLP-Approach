"Our college's main forte which I admire the most is its Discipline in all its academics as well as activities ,also it has very helpful teaching staff"
"I think instead of this clg any other clg would be a good choice in every department(classroom, facilities ,etc) "
Bvcoew faculty is helpful and helps students improve.
Best college for the ones who want only women college under SPPU.
Library book issue should open all days.
The campus is huge and clean along with it engineering college building and their classes are even good . The teaching staff is best.
"Library book issue should open all days.
Windows are not in good condition.

The campus of Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering for Women is mesmerising.The washroomâ€™s  should be developed.
College campus is good but washrooms should be developed with water tap in each of them and with one bucket.
"College is ok. Infrastructure is nt tht good. Teaching staff of some subjects are good bt rest !!u knoww . As per whole , College is okokk"
College campus is good but washroom should be developed. 
"Feels like a school more than a college, boring one. Not proper classrooms, not appropriate liberary it's all about campus that's good. Facilities are worst."
Pcs in all labs except 304 are not updated even they don't start .washroom is not good in condition

"The campus,library & classrooms are good."
College campus environment is good
"1)There should be specific area meant for all the programs and seminars to be conducted.
2)The Identity Card must be like the hanging ones which we can wear.
3) Toilets must be clean and water coolers should be turned on."
"Classroom - classrooms are digital, so this is the good part
College  campus - we have big ground but nothing happens in there like fests, gatherings at night time.
Library - we have good Library.

They should arrange prelims for insem and mostly for endsem."
Uptil now I am happy with things but haven't organised any type of big festival like other colleges.
Major focus in on academics rather than student personal development.
We've THE BEST NSS Unit.
Classrooms have smart TV which is good. Library do not have very huge collection of books. Overall almosphere is good. Teaching is good.
"First of all the restrooms stinks too bad as there are no taps in the individual slot. That's worse.Â No one wants to go in there unless there is whole lotta emergency!!Â They should atleast have a sanitary napkin vending machine.Â  Hell, there are no medicals nearby!!Â  The books in the library are so outdated, ig they're from my ancestors time.Â The library staff is rude as well.Â There are no wifi connection in the old pcs present in the laboratories. Rarely one or two does. Now the classrooms, there are more than 90 students in my class, 3 students have to share seats due to less number of benches. Me being ENTC student we have 2 batches. Now guess our condition. Most teachers are useless.Â They don't know anything and there they are, teaching us or should I say reading us the ppts.Â Well there is more, but I'll stop here. Hope it stays private.Â  Thanks!Â "
College library hours should be increased more around 7-8 pm 
"Library - library hours  should  be increased
"
The worst
It was good
Nice
Most of the PCs in the lab are not working so as engineers we need to work on them so pc's should be repaired on priority basis
College is quite strict but still is working on welfare of students . They focus on improving studentâ€™s academic status.
Washroom should be developed and as it is women's college so sanitary pads should be made available. 
"No official Mathematics III Staff due to this problems are there for understanding the subject, Permanent Faculty for maths 3 must be there."
great
Clg should provide or give more attention towards activities or pratical knowledge besides studies so that students can fill relax or her mind will be clear
College focuses on academic only and not overall development. Even Should give fair chances to each and every individual for self development.
"Their is need of improvement related to washrooms,the labs,and the college should organise technical events for students ."
It is a great college for academics as there is very educated and self discipline Staff. Teachers are very cooperative and supportive .But the College lacks the nontechincal activities and overall development of students. There are no mind relaxing activities taken .Only Academics is handle as a top priority. 
Major missing boys!!ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œðŸ¤ª
Frankly speaking..the faculty is biasing..they pay attention towards few students only..Other students are not given chance to even show their potential to prove themselves.
Good
The college provides separate ladies hostel with very good facilities which is a good feature about the college. 
We have a separate gymnasium for our college which encourages girls to actively participate in various sports activities. 
"The teachers here have a great experience in their professions , so if they have any issues can be resolved by them"
Everything is good
"I have a neutral opinion about my college. I've accepted the reality that I've to stay in this college only and I'll try to survive even under extreme conditions.
"
I have neutral opinion about my college.I have accepted college with all i have.Not that i don't have any complain about it but i also know that nobody is bothered to listen to it.our college doesn't pay any heed to any of our complaints.I have made my mind to stay another 2 years in this college whats so ever extreme conditions i have face.
Our campus is designed very aesthetically. The infrastructure and the atmosphere are both really good. The staff and students are all very supportive and always ready to help.
"All Students satisfied with the teaching methods, Co-curricular activities, Career guidance & other support services provided to the students by college."
